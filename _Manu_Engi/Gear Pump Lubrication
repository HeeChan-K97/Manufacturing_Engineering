Lubrication of bearings in the Gear Pump
The bearings in the pump would lubricate during its pumping motion using hydraulic oil that is within the pump and it is important that bearings being lubricated throughout its operation. Most of the wear occurs during the starting of the pump operation and problem will take place if bearings are not lubricated enough. In the case, the manufacturers use bearings that are coated with Teflon, making the coated materials to resist corrosion and heat.
