#Aluminium Alloys

Another suitable material for engine is aluminium alloys which has similar mechanical properties as the grey cast irons. 
Compare to grey iron, aluminium alloys have less weight. These alloys tend to resist wear, and corrosion of the material. 
However, aluminium alloys are expensive compared to grey cast iron alloys.
Generally, there are two commonly used types of aluminium alloys used in manufacturing the engine, 319 and A356 Aluminium alloy.

#319 Aluminium alloy:
Constituents:
* 87% - 89% of Aluminium
* 3.5% of Copper
* 6.0% of Silicon
* 1.0% of Iron
* 1.0% of Zinc
The common application of the 319 alloys are engine crankcases, gas and oil tank, and 	other engine parts.

#A356 Aluminium Alloy:
Constituents:
* 90% of Aluminium
* 7.0% of Silicon
* 0.3% of Magnesium
* 0.2% of Iron
The A356 alloys are used to make high strength aircraft frame or spaceship frame, 	machine parts, and truck chassis parts.
