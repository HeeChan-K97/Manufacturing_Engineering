# Sand Casting Mold

Mold consists of two halves:
  Cope: Upper half of mold
  Drag: Bottom half
Mold halves are contained in a box, called a flask
The two halves separate at the parting line

#Forming the Mold Cavity in Sand Casting

Mold cavity is formed by packing sand around a pattern which has the shape of the part
When the pattern is removed, the remaining cavity of the packed snad has desired shape of cast part
The pattern is usually oversized
Sand for the mold is moist and contains a binder to maintain its shape

#Use of a Core in the Mold Cavity

The mold cavity provides the external surfaces
Internal surfaces, determined by a core
In sand casting, cores are generally made of sand
