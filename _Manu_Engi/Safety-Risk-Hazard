#SAFETY
the condition of being safe from undergoing or causing hurt, injury, or loss

#RISK
the possibility of loss or injury
Risk is different to uncertainty - risk can be assigned probabilities and the randomness can be faced, while uncertainty applies where we cannot meaningful express the randomness in mathematical terms. 
                                   We also need to consider that there are many aspects of real world engineering problems that have inherent variability - natural phenomena 
                                   for example are variable like turbulence loads on an aeroplane, or wave loads on a ship.
Risk is everywhere and it is unavoidable. 
Risk cannot be eliminated (zero risk is not a realistic option), but it can be managed - there is an entire field of practice of risk management.

#Hazard 
a source of danger
it is the source or potential for harm in terms of human injury or ill health, damage to property, environment or a combination of these. 
In designing, engineers must consider all hazards for anyone coming into contact with the product or its components during its lifetime.
