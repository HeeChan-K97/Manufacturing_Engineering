With the presence of cavities:
•	Cause noise, vibration, and damage to gear pump components whilst they pass into the higher regions of pressure
•	Cavities or bubbles occupy space which result in loss in capacity
•	The pump would not build the same pressure anymore
•	The rate of flow inside the pump would decrease
