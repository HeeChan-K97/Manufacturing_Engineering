# What is the difference between a two-stroke and four-stroke Engine?

Two-stroke engine: Spark-plug fires once two strokes per combustion cycle.
Four stroke engines: Spark-plug fires once every four strokes per combustion cycle.

# Components of Two-stroke Engine

Piston: It moves between top dead center (TDC) and the bottom dead center (BDC) linearly. A thin film of oil between the piston rings and the cylinder liner separates the combustion space from the crankcase.
Connecting Rod (Conrod): Connects the piston to the crankshaft but there is no connection between the conrod and the crankshaft because of plain metal bearing and the lubrication oil which separates the two components.
Gudgeon Pin: Connects the connecting rod to the piston, also known as piston pin.
Crankshaft: Converts the linear reciprocating motion of the piston to rotary motion.
Cylinder head:
▪ Spark Plug: This is where the ignition of the air fuel mixture takes place. These spark plugs are employed only in Petrol/Gasoline engines. This plug is periodically igniting the fuel air mixtures in the combustion chamber.
▪ Cylinder Head: This is the casing for the cylinder housing the spark plug which helps to contain and host the internal combustion of fuel and air mixtures.
Crankcase:
▪ Crankcase: houses the internal parts of the engine. The air fuel mixture is compressed within the crankcase prior to the entering the transfer port.
▪ Crank Web: Stores the energy and reduce engine vibrations.
Air fuel Mixture Suction Port: The air fuel mixture is drawn into the crankcase through the suction port. A reed valve installed within the suction port acts as a non-return valve, to control the flow of the air fuel mixture.
Transfer Port: The compressed air fuel is moved from the crankcase to the combustion space with the help of transfer port.
Exhaust Gas port: The exhaust gas is removed from the combustion space through exhaust gas port.

# <Advantages of Two-stroke Engine>
Two-stroke engines do not have valves, simplifying their construction.
Two-stroke engines fire once every revolution (four-stroke engines fire once every other revolution). This gives two-stroke engines a significant power boost.
Two-stroke engines are lighter, and cost less to manufacture.
Two-stroke engines have the potential for about twice the power in the same size because there are twice as many power strokes per revolution.  

# <Disadvantages of Two-stroke Engine>
Two-stroke engines don't live as long as four-stroke engines. 
  Thelack of a dedicated lubrication system means that the parts of a two-stroke engine wear-out faster.
  Two-stroke engines require a mix of oil in with the gas to lubricate the crankshaft, connecting rod and cylinder walls.
Two-stroke oil can be expensive. Mixing ratio of 50:1 
      : burning about a litre of oil every 1,000 Km.
Two-stroke engines do not use fuel efficiently, yielding fewer Km per litre.
