# Grey Cast Iron Alloys

Grey cast iron, the grey color and appearance caused by graphite fractures in the material is where its name is derived from. 
Additionally, during cooling process graphite flake structure is created from the carbon contained in the component.

Grey iron is made of:
1. The most, carbon, 2.5% - 4.0%
2. Silicon, 1.0% - 3.0%
3. Manganese, 0.2% - 1.0%
4. Phosphorus 0.02% - 1.0%
5.Sulphur 0.02% - 0.25%

The size and shape of the graphite flakes bonded in the compound determines the properties of grey iron. 
The grey iron has very low cost of production. It has high thermal conductivity which transfer heat easily through the metal. 
Additionally, it has high tensile strength, and ductility. Some of other usage of the grey iron is valves, truck suspension components, and gears.
