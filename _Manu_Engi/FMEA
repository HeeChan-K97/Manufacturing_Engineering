#Implementing FMEA in several steps

Steps:
1. Determine the failure modes
2. Determine potential effects of each failure mode
3. Determine a severity (S) rating for each effect from the Severity rating table.
4. Determine an occurrence (O) rating for each cause from the Occurrence rating table.
5. Determine a detection (D) rating for each cause from the Detection rating table
6. Calculate the risk priority number for each effect
7. Prioritise or rank the failure modes for action
8. Take action to eliminate the failure mode or reduce its severity
9. Recalculate the risk priority number as failure modes are reduced or eliminated
