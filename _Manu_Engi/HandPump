#Components of Vertical Piston Hand Pump

Pump Rod (Aluminium Shaft)        : A solid steel rod about 6mm in diameter, that connects the piston valve and seals to the pump handle. 
                            By operating the pump handle, we can move the pump rod along with the piston valves and the seals (piston assembly) in a vertical motion

Upper Cap                         :This feature seals the interior of the pump cylinder and limits the motion of the piston valve which ultimately defines the water flow

Cylindrical Barrel (PVC Main Body): This is the main body of the pump cylinder. For this design, a 38mm to 40mm (inner diameter) PVC pipe is used to construct this main body of the pump. 
                                    Inside here is the piston valve pushed against the inside wall of the cylinder barrel and acts as a seal. 
                                    This allows the pressure differential between the upper and lower part of the cylinder to be maintained during pump operation

Piston Valve                      : This a non-return valve (one-way valve) which maintains flow of water into the upper cylinder when the pump rod is moved downward.
                                    When moved upward, the valve is closed to push the water to the delivery outlet (Joiner Socket)

Piston Seals                      : Generally, these seals are made of rubber that stops the piston assembly against the inner walls of the cylinder.
                                    During the piston assembly movement, a pressure differential is felt on the piston seals. 
                                    It is this difference in pressure that allows the water movement inside the cylinder and to the delivery outlet

Foot Valve                        : Another one-way valve, typically situated in the inner walls of the lower cylinder. 
                                    This valve manages the upward water flow from the water table to the cylinder when the pump rod is pulled and holds it 
                                    inside the cylinder when the pump rod is pushed inside the cylinder

PVC Junction                      : This junction pipe is acts as a connection by connecting three different parts of the pump together. 
                                    The bottom hole is connected with main body, whilst the top is connected to the part with the upper cap and the side hole is connected to the output pipe. 
                                    This is a stationary part with a minor stress, due to the flexing in the pump. Whereas, the major role of this part is to manage the water flow with angle
