Purpose of Dowels
Dowels are used to cylindrical small component that used for alignment of the  housing components of the gear pump. 
Two dowels are keeping the shaft in line to come through the cover/cap of the pump.

Thrust Plate(s)
Thrust plates hold gear shafts firmly in its position and helps them to rotate in steady position. 
Thrust plates contain a seal on it which allow oil to suck inside the pump on its cut off side but prevent any leakage on the other side. 
So the cut off side is always facing the suction port side where oil comes in and blocked side is facing the pressure side, pressure port. 
Also, these plates absorbd the pressure inside the pump to ensure coming fluid is kept inside the gear pumps.
