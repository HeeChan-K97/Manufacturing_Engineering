Rotation mechanism of the Gear Pump

Inside the suction port there are two gears, one is the driver gear and the other one is the Idler(driven) gear. 
According to the figure shown below the driver gear is the blue one and it is rotating in 
clockwise whilst making the contacting Idler gear to rotate in counter-clockwise motion.
The port on the left has a larger hole and it is called suction port where oil sucked inside the housing through it. 
Also, there is lower pressure on the suction port to allow the oil to follow the path as the arrow indicates in the figure. 
The port on the other side is called pressure port and it is where high pressure is generated due to the rotation of the gears
and the size of its hole is smaller than the suction port. The size of the suction port is larger than the pressure port mainly to avoid cavitation.
