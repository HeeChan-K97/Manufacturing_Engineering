# Advantages
1. Two stroke engines do not have valves, simplifying their construction.
2. Two stroke engines fire once every revolution (four stroke
   engines fire once every other revolution). This gives two
   stroke engines a significant power boost.
3. Two stroke engines are lighter, and cost less to manufacture.
4. Two stroke engines have the potential for about twice the
   power in the same size because there are twice as many power
   strokes per revolution.
   
# Disadvantages

1. Two stroke engines don't live as long as four stroke engines. 
   The lack of a dedicated lubrication system means that the parts of a two
   stroke engine wear out faster. Two stroke engines require a
   mix of oil in with the gas to lubricate the crankshaft, connecting rod and cylinder walls.
2. Two stroke oil can be expensive. Mixing ratio of 50:1: burning about a litre of oil every 1,000 Km.
3. Two stroke engines do not use fuel efficiently, yielding fewer Km per litre.
4. Two stroke engines produce more pollution. From: The combustion of the oil in the gas.
   The oil makes all two stroke engines smoky to some extent, and a badly worn two stroke engine can emit more oily smoke.
   Each time a new mix of air/fuel is loaded into the combustion chamber, part of it leaks out through the exhaust port.
